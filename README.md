Description: As a developer, I want to revamp the existing backend codebase and integrate comprehensive code quality checks, so that the system operates more efficiently and maintains high standards of reliability and maintainability.

Acceptance Criteria:

Refactor the existing backend code to improve readability, efficiency, and scalability.
Integrate continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes with automated code quality checks.
Implement static code analysis tools such as SonarQube or ESLint to identify potential issues before they move to production.
Set up a code review process that enforces coding standards and best practices across the development team.
Achieve a reduction in known bugs and vulnerabilities as reported by the new tools.
Documentation is updated to reflect changes in the codebase and new practices implemented.
