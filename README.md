Ticket 1: Vision Model Development for Field Identification
Title: Develop Vision Model to Identify "Inpatient/Outpatient" Field

Description: As a developer, I want to implement a vision-based model that can accurately detect the "Inpatient/Outpatient" field in medical documents, so that the system can correctly categorize patient types and streamline data processing.

Acceptance Criteria:

The model detects the "Inpatient/Outpatient" field with at least 95% accuracy across diverse document formats.
The system flags documents with unrecognized formats for manual review.
Seamless integration with the main application to ensure efficient data extraction.
Comprehensive documentation of the development process is provided, including data handling and model evaluation.
